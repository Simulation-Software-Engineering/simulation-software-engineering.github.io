# Homepage of Simulation-Software-Engineering organization

This repository forwards the URL `simulation-software-engineering.github.io`
to the lecture's homepage at <https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/>.

The actual homepage is currently located at a dedicated [homepage repository](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/homepage)
and delivered as a [GitHub project homepage](https://pages.github.com/). The
reason for this is that the deployment of the homepage via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
is easier for projects than for organizations as described in
[the documentation of mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#organization-and-user-pages).
